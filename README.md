A BASIC TO-DO WEBAPP

Developed a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks. The to-do web app will allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list will be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks will appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.

I also added a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user will be able to delete or edit tasks from it.

To further increase the web app's complexity and make it more detailed, I added the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.
